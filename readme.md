# CRM - INDEXED DB

Hi, this is a project realized in course [JavaScript Moderno Gu√≠a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). The objective of this project is to be able to follow up with our clients, in order to collect the data of a new client, edit it, and delete it.

## Technologies

I have used basic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. Most of the styles are made in **Bootstrap**.

### JavaScript

In **Javascript** we use **Indexed DB** to store the clients in a _real database_, and to be able to track them.
In this case we use **modules** to better manage each Function for each page, how for example for the _UI we use messages to show the actions_ to the user. We do the _data validation_ and then add them to **DB**, the data saved in **DB** can be edited, deleted if the user who administers it requires it.
